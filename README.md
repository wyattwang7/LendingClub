# LendingClub: Predict loan charge-offs and calculate expected loan loss

LendingClub Corp. is an online lender who makes loans online to consumers and sells the loans to investors.

In this project, we analyze the loan data of LendingClub from the year 2007 to the second quarter in 2019. The data explores the demographic dimensions of personal loans and loan status (fully paid/ charged off), which is available on their website once you create an account.

Our goal is to identify the risk of unsecured personal loans. Specifically, a machine learning model was developed to predict the probability of full payment and charge off. On top of that, we utilize the model to predict the expected loan loss from current borrowers, providing insights about risk control and loss reduction.
